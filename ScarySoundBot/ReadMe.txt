This was another joke project. Arduino set up with small (8 ohm?) speakers to play ominous noises when the connected
photoresistor detected that it was dark. I didn't have any parts that allowed me to play actual MP3s so I had to 
follow a tutorial to convert them into a format that the speaker could play, which hurt the sound quality pretty bad.
Regardless, it was fun to make.

I love joke projects.
