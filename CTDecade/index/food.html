<center><p>Food became interesting during the 1910s. Due to World War I, rationing was encouraged. This led to people working with simpler ingredients.</p></center>
<br>
<center><p>People ate many forms of fruit, such as fruit preserves, sherbet, and canned fruit. Beef, potatoes, soup, and hot dogs were popular choices for main and side courses during this decade. For sweets, there was many options like Oreos, Lorna Doone cookies, Life Savers, Clark Bars, marshmallow creme, and MoonPies. </p></center>
