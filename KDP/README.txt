This is a dumb one. The .exe is in the dist folder. It was intended as a prank program that I was going to run on a friend's computer at school. When it is active, there's low chances for things to happen when you're typing like double backspacing, random uppercasing, adding extra letters, etc. It's really only designed to be mildly inconvienent. Unfortunately, the school's anti-malware couldn't recognize it and never let me open it. A shame. (but probably for the best.)
To start it, run the .exe and press ctrl+k+c. To stop it, do ctrl+x+j. Might have to mash the keys a few times for it to actually work. It's not very efficient and also takes up a lot of CPU. Never intended to be efficient though, just funny.
