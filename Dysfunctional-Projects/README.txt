These are projects that didn't quite work out, or broke at some point in time but I still feel like they're worth
remembering. 

Notepad/Stickynote:
This one was actually a fully functioning Tkinter GUI Python notepad. You can pin it, save text,
it has different color themes, font choices/sizes, etc. It broke when I transferred my files through dropbox + I 
forgot to copy over the actual Python files for it. I'm at college right now so I don't have access to the old files
but when I go back home I'll probably try and repair it and put it into the functional projects. It was my first 
big Python project and I was really happy with how it turned out. It'll be fixed someday (probably), or entirely remade.

Echolocation Glove:
This one was a case of me being a bit overly ambitious. I wanted to attach a motor which would spin 
in its case and make vibrations (which I got out of some cheap massage pillow from a yardsale) and strap it onto
the back of a glove with an ultrasonic sensor on the front. In theory, you could see with your hand (if the sensor
on your palm detected that it was too close to something, the glove would start vibrating). It sort-of worked, as I 
believe I had the sensor working with the motor. Unfortunately, I wasn't able to simplify it to fit onto a glove because
I would have needed a soldering iron + figured out how to add a switch so it wasn't always on + come up with a wireless
power source. Cool idea, less than ideal execution. Atleast I succeeded on part of it!
